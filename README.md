# ami-sh
Ami-sh is a hobby project shell designed for UNIX systems.

## Using ami-sh
Ami-SH is very minimal at current, however it does have config support!<br>
It will look for configuration in your "home folder" under the file .ami-shrc<br>

You can find an example config in the root of this project!

## AI Policy of this project.
AI has been used to assist with some parts of this project, and there may be residual bits, however all code has been rewritten and manually verifed by me (a human) and I ask that you do not use AI to make bug reports which elsewise would not be made. They waste my time, waste your time and clog the repository!
